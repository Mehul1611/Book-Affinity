# Book-Affinity

This project is designed to extract personality traits from book summaries using the Groq API, process the results, and store them in a PostgreSQL database. The project leverages SQLAlchemy for database interaction and environment variables for secure API key management. It supports trait extraction based on predefined traits, integrates with a PostgreSQL database, and performs data handling without the need for CSV files.

## Features
- **Add New Books**: Add books by providing their title and author.
- **Quiz-based Recommendations**: Take a quiz based on a bookâ€™s themes and traits, and receive personalized book recommendations.
- **Trait Extraction**: Use Groq's LLM model to extract personality traits from book summaries.
- **Database Integration**: Store books and recommendations in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Environment Variable Support**: Store sensitive information (API keys, model names, and database connection strings) securely using `.env` files.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for failed API requests.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PostgreSQL Database (or any supported SQL database)
- Required Python libraries: **`pip install -r requirements.txt`**
